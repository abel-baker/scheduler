## Features

Plan your day with hourly entries for the entire workday.  Type in your custom calendar event and click the bookmark icon to save.  Your events will be saved between browser sessions so you don't have to worry about losing your data.

Keep track of where you are along in the workday with time-based highlighting of the current hour and past & future hours.

Dynamic save icons provide feedback about the saved state of your entries.
